        <h1>Testing is really about people, not tests</h1>
        <p>
            You've been <b>building your testing skills</b> (hopefully
            with my help!) and you are ready to start <b>getting other
                folks writing tests</b> but you're <b>encountering resistance</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            How can you <b>convince them there is value in writing tests</b>?
        </p>
        <p>
            I <b>learned the hard way</b> that one of the <b>least-understood</b>
            parts of learning the skills you need to write tests for your
            PHP code is <b>managing the expectations of others</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tests are written by people, not machines</b>!
        </p>
        <p>
            In <b>Building Test-Driven Developers</b> I share with you
        the lessons I've learned over more than a decade to <b>challenge your thoughts</b>
            on what testing is all about. You <b>need more than just a testing framework</b>
            to get people other than yourself committed to the practice of
            writing tests.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this book I help <b>add to your programming skills</b> by
            discussing topics that are <b>critical to understanding</b>
        why people often won't commit to writing tests.
        <b>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a "testing culture"</li>
            <li>Handling things when there are no tests</li>
            <li>Why testing should be "just part of the job"</li>
            <li>What to do with tests nobody runs</li>
            <li>Does "use test doubles" vs. "never use test doubles" really matter?</li>
            <li>Dealing with difficult people</li>
        </ul>
        </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to <b>build people skills</b> to go along with all
            those <b>great testing skills</b> you've been building.
            I'm here to help with those too!
