        <h1>Learn To Test Like A Grumpy Programmer - The Course!</h1>
        <p>
            All the pieces are available for you to learn how to test
            your PHP code -- even if you've never done it before. The
            problem? You have to spend a lot of time searching for
            answers to some very open-ended questions. You hesitate
            to even get started because you are not sure that you are
            doing ANY of this correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Does this sound familiar?
        </p>
        <p>
            What you want is to sit down with someone who has done all
            this before and can explain it to you in a way that doesn't
            make testing your code seem intimidating. You don't have
            to suffer or be scared you're doing it wrong! <b>Learn To
