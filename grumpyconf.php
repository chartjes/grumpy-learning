        <h2>Do you trust me?</h2>
    <p>
    50 attendees<br>
    6 high-impact speakers from the PHP world<br>
    1 birthday party<br>
    </p>
    <p>I helped run <a href="https://truenorthphp.ca"><b>True North PHP</b></a> for five years, and now I wanted to do <b>something different</b>. I
want to use my <b>conference organizing experience</b> to do something <b>unique</b> for you.</p>
    <p>
    <b>GrumpyConf 2018</b> is your chance to hear from some of the PHP community's most <b>impactful speakers</b> in the morning,
    and then <b>interact with them</b> and your fellow attendees in an <b><a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/OpenSpaces.html">open spaces</a></b>
    environment in the afternoon. Finally, we'll be having a birthday party at the end - it's my 47th birthday! (Black Forest cake will be provided)
    </p> 
    <p>
    Your ticket is for <b>3 days</b> of the conference, running March 22-24, 2018. It <b>includes a room</b> at the venue, the beautiful
    <a href="http://www.elmhurstinn.com/">Elm Hurst Inn</a> in <b>Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada</b> (about 90 minutes west of Toronto).
    Breakfast is provided for guests staying overnight at the Inn, <b>lunch and snacks</b> will be provided to attendees.
    </p>
    <h2>Speakers</h2>
    <p>I've selected <b>6 speakers</b> who I feel will push both your <b>PHP skills</b> and your <b>professional development</b>. So who is coming?</p>
    <h3>Ed Finkler</h3>
    <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/ed_finkler.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>You might know him through his work with <a href="https://osmihelp.org">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a> or recording
    a <a href="https://devhell.info">podcast</a> with me. He's also a <b>good developer</b> and an even <b>better communicator</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Sure, Ed is a close friend but his message in an <b>important one</b> to help you understand that <b>coding is about people</b>
    more than it is about the technology</p>
    <h3>Moses Ngone</h3> 
    <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/moses_ngone.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>There are some folks whom you come across online and you say to yourself
"I need to figure out how to <b>get this person to speak at my event</b>" and
things never line up quite right. This time around, I made sure to ask
Moses to come and talk.</p>
    <p>His background is one of picking lots of
<b>interesting (at least to me) projects</b> and his experiences will be
invaluable to someone looking to <b>build a career</b> full of opportunities to
work on things that <b>interact with the real world</b>.</p>
    <h3>Four more speakers to be revealed...</h3>
    <p>Please carefully read the conference's <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Code of Conduct</a> before purchasing a ticket. 
    Chris strongly believes in a safe and supportive environment for all attendees.</p>
