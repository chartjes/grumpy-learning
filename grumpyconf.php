        <h2>High Performance PHP and Professional Development</h2>
    <p>
    50 attendees<br>
    6 high-impact speakers from the PHP world<br>
    1 birthday party<br>
    </p>
    <p>I helped run <a href="https://truenorthphp.ca"><b>True North PHP</b></a> for five years, and now I wanted to do <b>something different</b>. I
want to use my <b>conference organizing experience</b> to do something <b>unique</b> for you.</p>
    <p>
    <b>GrumpyConf 2018</b> is your chance to hear from some of the PHP community's most <b>impactful speakers</b> in the morning,
    and then <b>interact with them</b> and your fellow attendees in an <b><a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/OpenSpaces.html">open spaces</a></b>
    environment in the afternoon. Finally, we'll be having a birthday party at the end - it's my 47th birthday! (Black Forest cake will be provided)
    </p>
    <p>
    Your ticket is for <b>3 days</b> of the conference, running March 22-24, 2018. It <b>includes a room</b> at the venue, the beautiful
    <a href="http://www.elmhurstinn.com/">Elm Hurst Inn</a> in <b>Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada</b> (about 90 minutes west of Toronto).
    Breakfast is provided for guests staying overnight at the Inn, <b>lunch and snacks</b> will be provided to attendees.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Here</h2>
<p>The closest airport is <a href="http://www.flylondon.ca/">London International Airport</a>, a smaller regional airport that offers connections to larger airports, like <a href="https://torontopearson.com/">Toronto Pearson</a>. Either way you will need additional ground transportation to get to the venue. I recommend car rental or the use of services like <a href="https://reservation.robertq.com/airbus/">Robert Q</a>.</p>
<p>Additional flight + ground transportation options are available from <a href="http://www.metroairport.com/">Detroit Metropolitan</a> or even <a href="http://www.buffaloairport.com/">Buffalo Niagara International Airport</a></p>
    <h2>Speakers</h2>
    <p>I've selected <b>6 speakers</b> who I feel will push both your <b>PHP skills</b> and your <b>professional development</b>. So who is coming?</p>
    <h3>Ed Finkler</h3>
    <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/ed_finkler.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>You might know him through his work with <a href="https://osmihelp.org">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a> or recording
    a <a href="https://devhell.info">podcast</a> with me. He's also a <b>good developer</b> and an even <b>better communicator</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Sure, Ed is a close friend but his message in an <b>important one</b> to help you understand that <b>coding is about people</b>
    more than it is about the technology</p>
    <h3>Moses Ngone</h3> 
    <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/moses_ngone.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>There are some folks whom you come across online and you say to yourself
"I need to figure out how to <b>get this person to speak at my event</b>" and
things never line up quite right. This time around, I made sure to ask
Moses to come and talk.</p>
    <p>His background is one of picking lots of
<b>interesting (at least to me) projects</b> and his experiences will be
invaluable to someone looking to <b>build a career</b> full of opportunities to
work on things that <b>interact with the real world</b>.</p>
    <h3>Sara Golemon</h3>
    <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/sara_golemon.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>She's part of the <b>core PHP team</b>, the <b>release manager</b> for PHP 7.2 and worked on <b>HHVM and Hack</b>.  She also
    always calls me Grumpy. Sara is an <b>entertaining speaker</b> who loves talking about <b>programming languages</b> She spoke
    at TrueNorthPHP and I'm happy she accepted my invitation to come and speak at GrumpyConf 2018.
    </p>
    <h3>Eryn O'Neill</h3>
        <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/eryn_oneill.jpeg" /></p>
        <p>I've been speaking at conferences since 2005 and I've seen several
        people <b>go from attendee to nervous speaker to in-demand speaker</b>. Eryn is
        one of those people!
        </p>
        <p>Her <b>observations</b> about the <b>complementary skills</b> a
        programer needs (what a lot of people derogatorily refer to as "soft
skills") to succeed are <b>insightful and on-target</b>. When you combine that
            with her experiences as a <b>freelance developer</b>, you'll quickly realize
why I invited her to come and talk.
        </p>
    <h3>Matthew Weier-O'Phinney</h3>
        <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/mwop.jpeg" /></p>
        <p>From <b>divinity major at college</b> to "Supreme Allied Commander" of <b>Zend Framework</b>, Matthew is one
        of the most <b>well-rounded</b> people I've gotten to know over my years in this industry. I had been trying for years
        to get him to speak at my events, and I'm <b>grateful he accepted</b> my invitation this time.
        </p>
        <p>Matthew is also one of the lucky few that was inspired by my <b>4-day work week</b> strategy and made it work for himself!</p> 
    <h3>Lorna Mitchell</h3>
        <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/lornajane.jpeg" /></p>
        <p>The very first time I <b>saw Lorna speak</b> she did it with <b>no slides</b>, which blew my mind! She is also another speaker whom I have invited over the years to hop onto a plane and fly across the Atlantic to come to Canada and speak.</p>
        <p>Lorna always <b>packs a lot of knowledge</b> into her talks, and I never come away from any of her talks without <b>learning something new</b>. Lorna's talent lies in <b>cutting through complexity</b> and teaching you <b>what you really need to know</b>.</p>
    <p>Please carefully read the conference's <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Code of Conduct</a> before purchasing a ticket. 
    Chris strongly believes in a safe and supportive environment for all attendees.</p>
