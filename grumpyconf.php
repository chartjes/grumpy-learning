        <h2>High Performance PHP and Professional Development</h2>
      <p><b>GrumpyConf is back for 2019!</b></p>
      <h5>You can see details about last year's event <a href="grumpyconf2018.php">here</a></h5>
      <p>
          Back for another edition, GrumpyConf 2019 is your opportunity to listen to some of the <b>PHP community's best speakers</b>
          before lunch and then learn from them and other attendees via <b><a href="http://wintertechforum.com/open-spaces/">open spaces</a></b>
          sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The venue is the beautiful
    <a href="http://www.elmhurstinn.com/">Elm Hurst Inn</a> in <b>Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada</b> (about 90 minutes west of Toronto.
    </p>
      <p>
          This year, the <b>All-inclusive ticket</b> includes the following:
          <ul>
          <li>conference ticket</li>
          <li>three nights' stay at the resort (March 21st, 22nd, 23rd)</li>
          <li>dinner on the 22nd and 23rd</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
      This is in addition to the lunch being provided at the event and breakfast provided by the resort in the mornings.
      </p>
      <p>There is a ticket for <b>local attendees</b> that covers attendance and the lunch being provided</p>

    <p>Each of the <b>talented speakers</b> has a specific area of expertise, and you will have the opportunity to <b>discuss your real-world situations</b>
    in small groups with them. I want you to have the type of <b>access that is almost impossible to get</b> at traditional conferences. If you've ever heard
    of people talk about the "hallway track" at events, well, this entire event is like <b>one big "hallway track"</b></p>
      <p>For details on tickets and pricing, please visit our page at <a href="https://ti.to/grumpyconf/grumpyconf-2019">Ti.to</a></p>

    <h2>Getting Here</h2>
<p>The closest airport is <a href="http://www.flylondon.ca/">London International Airport</a>, a smaller regional airport that offers connections to larger airports, like <a href="https://torontopearson.com/">Toronto Pearson</a>. Either way you will need additional ground transportation to get to the venue. I recommend car rental or the use of services like <a href="https://reservation.robertq.com/airbus/">Robert Q</a>.</p>
<p>Additional flight + ground transportation options are available from <a href="http://www.metroairport.com/">Detroit Metropolitan</a> or even <a href="http://www.buffaloairport.com/">Buffalo Niagara International Airport</a></p>

    <h2>Speakers</h2>
    <p>I've selected <b>4 speakers</b> who I feel have a combination of <b>technical and personal skills</b> that can  So who is speaking?</p>
      <h3>Elizabeth Marie Smith</h3>
      <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/elizabethsmith.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Elizabeth is the person who <b>got me into mentoring</b> with her infectious energy surrounding <b>teaching people</b></p>
      <p>She is one of the few people putting a lot of work into making <b>PHP run on Windows</b> and has probably forgotten more
          about the internals of PHP than I will ever know. I always come away from her talks saying to myself <b>"wow, I knew way less about this than I thought"</b></p>
    <h3>Mark Story</h3>
    <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/mark-story-2018.jpg" /></p>
      <p>
          I've known Mark for quite a while through my experiences with the <b>CakePHP framework</b>, where Mark is the lead developer.
          Mark is a "local" (living in the Greater Toronto Area) and is undefeated against me in games of Magic The Gathering.
      </p>
      <h4>So you want to run an open source project?</h4>
      <p>9 years ago, I thought it would be a good idea to get involved in Open Source being
          an Art Major who had no experience writing software professionally. In the intervening
          years I've been fortunate enough to build a global community and work with folks from
          every continent.
      </p>
        <p>
          In this talk I'd like to share my experiences running a sizable open source project
          and some of the activities, behaviors and organizational tactics could help
          you on your own open source journey.
      </p>
    <h3>Gemma Anible</h3>
        <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/gemma-anible.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Gemma works from the <b>fjords of Norway</b> and is going to <b>share her experiences</b> with something she did TWICE that makes a lot of developers lose sleep: <b>migrating
          your code to newer versions of a PHP framework</b></p>
    <h3>Marco Pivetta</h3>
        <p><img height=240 width=240 src="images/marco-pivetta.jpg" /></p>
      <p>I worked with Marco as part of a <b>developer co-op</b> and learned just how skilled and talented he really is. He is a
      <b>contributor to Doctrine and Zend Framework</b> and cares about <b>code quality, maintainability, and testing<b></b> in a way that few other
      people I have come across exhibit.</p>
    <h2>Conference Code Of Conduct</h2>
    <p>Please carefully read the conference's <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Code of Conduct</a> before purchasing a ticket.
    I strongly believe in a safe and supportive environment for all attendees.</p>
